# spherstat

This repository contains the source code of an R package **spherstat**
for analysing point patterns on a sphere. 

The package was written by Thomas Lawrence for his Masters Thesis in Statistics 
at the University of Western Australia. 

The package also includes C code, written by Adrian Baddeley, which re-implements 
some of the core calculations.
